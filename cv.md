## Summary

I am a **very motivated** person and always go all the way. When I have a goal, I will achieve it by any means. I have a dream: ***creating a family***. I perfectly understand that working even at a military-space enterprise - there will not be enough funds to realize my dream. I started from scratch to learn **Javascript**. As they said at the first webinar: 
> "Two hours a day is enough for you."

But no. I sit for **4 hours** a day and every time I discover something new in programming. That's because I have a goal - to get into **EPAM**! **And I will achieve this!**
